        <p>The color input type (Fig. 3.1; lines 20&ndash;21) enables the user to enter a color. Opera displays a color picker control that shows the default color (black) with a down arrow that, when clicked, shows a drop-down with 20 basic colors (Fig. 3.2). The user can select a color or click the Other... button to select from additional basic colors or create a custom color. At the time of this writing, most browsers render the color input type as a text field in which the user can enter a hexidecimal code.</p>
